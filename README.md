🚀 Tech Stack

    Next.js – Server-side rendering and static site generation for fast performance and SEO.

    Lucide React – Lightweight and consistent icon set for modern UI elements.

✨ Features
🖼️ Clean & Minimal Design

Crafted with simplicity and clarity in mind. The layout is easy to scan and draws focus to your most important content—your projects, experience, and contact details.
📱 Fully Responsive

The site looks and functions beautifully across all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors. Tailwind’s responsive classes ensure layout adaptability.
⚡ Fast & Optimized

Built with Next.js, the site is statically generated by default, resulting in fast load times, excellent SEO, and minimal hosting costs.
🧩 Modular Components

The website is organized into reusable components like Header, Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact, and Footer. You can easily modify or extend them to suit your needs.
🎯 SEO & Accessibility Friendly

Next.js optimizations and semantic HTML elements make your site search-engine friendly. Tailwind and Lucide also support accessible components by default.
🎨 Easy Customization

Modify Tailwind classes, replace content in the data or content files, and drop in your personal branding and images with minimal effort.
